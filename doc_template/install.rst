Install Guide
=============
This guide is a resource for using the Allen SDK package.
It is maintained by the `Allen Institute for Brain Science <http://www.alleninstitute.org/>`_.

.. ATTENTION::
    As of October 2019, we have dropped Python 2 support.

Quick Start
--------------------------
 #. Use a virtual environment, e.g `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>`_. After the installation is complete, open up a terminal (in Windows open Anaconda3 Command Prompt).

 #. Create a new conda environment and install the AllenSDK using pip

    .. code-block:: bash

         conda create -n allensdk
         conda activate allensdk
         pip install allensdk

 #. Add conda env to ipykernel so that the notebook can use it

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install ipykernel
        python -m ipykernel install --user --name=allensdk

 #. Explore notebooks.

    * `Legacy notebooks <https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html>`_
    * `visual behavior/visual coding notebooks <https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

    Download one of our many notebooks to a new folder.

    In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Jupyter Notebook example and start jupyer notebook

    .. code-block:: bash

        jupyter notebook

Other Distribution Formats
--------------------------
The Allen SDK is also available from the Github source repository.
